## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization ##

**For this part , we have Completed the following steps:**
- Got our dataset by Visiting the USGS GeoJSON Feed Link and choosing a dataset to visualize.
- Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:
 * Using Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from our dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
 * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
 * Created a legend that provide context for our map data.
**The resulting map is displayed down below**

## Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)##

**For this part , we have Completed the following steps:**
- Plotted a second dataset on our map , illustrating the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 
To accomplish that , we have:
- Gotten a new dataset. To do so, we Visited https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates  Link and chose a new dataset
- we pulled in this dataset and visualized it alongside our earthquake's data. 
- We then added other base maps to choose from.
- Furthermore , we put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
- Finally ,  we added a layer controls to our map.
**The resulting map is displayed down below**
