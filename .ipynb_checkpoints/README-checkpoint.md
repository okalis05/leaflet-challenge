## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization ##

*** For this part , we'll Complete the following steps:***
- Get your dataset. To do so, we'll Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed Link and choose a dataset to visualize.
- Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
 * Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from our dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
 * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
 * Create a legend that will provide context for our map data.

## Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)##

*** For this part , we'll Complete the following steps:***
- Plot a second dataset on our map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 
for that purpose , we'll:
- Get a new dataset. To do so, we'll Visit https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates  Link and choose a new dataset
- You will need to pull in this dataset and visualize it alongside your original data. 
- Plot the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.
- Add other base maps to choose from.
- Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
- Add layer controls to our map.
